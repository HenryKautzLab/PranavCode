Here I have added two starter codes. The Flickr one with other extraneous files outside is my first version for experimentation / getting used to things.
In the TikTokSS folder is the most recent one where I used an exisiting model to analyze an image and retreieve relevant data by adding specifications to a prompt.

This repo will continue to be updated as I try to advance and add layers of complexity to my projects.
